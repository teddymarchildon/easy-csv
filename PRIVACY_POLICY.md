# Privacy Policy

**Easy CSV** — Last updated: February 16, 2026

## The Short Version

Easy CSV does not collect, transmit, or share any of your data. Period.

## Details

- **No data collection.** Easy CSV does not collect personal information, usage analytics, telemetry, crash reports, or any other data.
- **No network access.** The app makes zero network requests. Your files and edits never leave your machine.
- **No accounts.** There is no sign-up, login, or user account of any kind.
- **Local storage only.** Your preferences (such as theme selection and recent file history) are stored locally on your device using standard application storage. This data is never transmitted anywhere.
- **No third-party services.** Easy CSV does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## File Access

Easy CSV accesses files on your computer only when you explicitly open them (via the file picker, drag-and-drop, or recent files list). Files are read and written locally. No copies are made outside of the locations you choose.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be included with the app. Given that Easy CSV has no mechanism to collect data, meaningful changes are unlikely.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on the project's repository.
